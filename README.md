### Lungs Detector

#### What is Lungs Detector?

lung detector is an application created by our team aiming to improve efficiency for doctors who are specialized on radiology

this application is simple and easy to use, user only need to have x-ray image of the chest then select it via file picker and then analyze it

the anayzing process is done by using machine learning using tenserflow lite, the uploaded image will be matched with the existing trained dataset

##### what kind of illness this application can analyze?

currently this application can only differentiate between three datasets, which is **normal, penunomia,and covid**

##### plan for the future

our plan for the future is to expand this application so it can detect more kind of illness, adding more informations, and improving it's accuracy by adding and training 
the datasets, both new and old, then we also plan to implement data tracking on the application so they will be able to collect a large amount of data for decision support
on handling the illness
